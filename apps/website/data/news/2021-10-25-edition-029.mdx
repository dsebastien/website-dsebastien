## Welcome to the 29th edition

Another week, another newsletter! I hope that you all had a great one ‚òÄÔ∏è

I honestly didn‚Äôt see the week pass by. It‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm now living a seemingly endless day, separated by ~2-hour naps. It makes me think of [Groundhog Day](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048) for some reason‚Ä¶ On the bright side, my wife and I have been binge-watching ‚ÄúLucifer‚Äù on Netflix. It‚Äôs been fun. Especially thanks to the wonderful British accent of [Tom Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Ellis_(actor)).

It‚Äôs one of those shows that _has_ to be watched with the original audio. Watching it in any other language than the original would be a cardinal sin (pun intended). Here in the French-speaking part of Belgium, 99.9% of TV shows are dubbed, which I‚Äôve always found incredibly sad. The thing is that we‚Äôre right next to France, where there‚Äôs always been this tradition of dubbing everything. Most of the time, translations are far from great, jokes fall flat, and there are lip-sync issues. Those points alone have been enough to motivate me to learn English back when I was a teenager. For some reason though, many friends and relatives prefer watching everything in French. I just don‚Äôt get it. Their loss, right?

Anyways, enough digression. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## Entrepreneurial journey

This week I‚Äôve been reflecting on my entrepreneurial journey, which started nearly three years ago. The lack of sleep didn‚Äôt help and I felt somewhat depressed by the lack of success so far. This pushed me to write a long thread on Twitter. Check it out if you‚Äôre curious about my journey:

<Tweet tweetLink="dSebastien/status/1448544802975453184" />

Here‚Äôs a quick summary if you‚Äôre in a hurry:

-   Worked on two Startup projects that didn‚Äôt go anywhere. The team was not really committed
-   Started freelancing back in 2019 and immediately got to 15K MRR
-   Worked [2000 hours on a Startup project that never launched](https://medium.com/swlh/20-months-in-2k-hours-spent-and-200k-lost-a-story-about-resilience-and-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-69fd4f61ef59)
-   Almost killed my own company in the process (I had ~1K ‚Ç¨ left in the bank and had to lend it money to keep it alive)
-   Wrote a book about TypeScript
-   Wrote 100+ articles and gained ~$1.5K
-   Self-published two books of my Dev Concepts series
-   Launched and started growing this newsletter
-   Started coaching fellow software developers
-   Started growing my audience on Twitter
-   Found the energy to get ‚Äúback in the ring‚Äù and start working on a new Startup project

Some entrepreneurs seem to be able to go from zero to a successful startup in less than six months. But here‚Äôs the thing: most of those success stories only focus on the end of the journey. Most of those people have actually struggled for a number of years before they created that last successful product. Of course, there are outliers though.

Looking back at the last three years, I clearly see the mistakes I‚Äôve made. But I‚Äôm glad I made some because it means that I‚Äôve learned a lot as well. If we don‚Äôt make mistakes, we‚Äôre not learning.

In the process, I‚Äôve learned a lot about myself. I proved my resilience, my grit, and my motivation. I‚Äôve learned a ton about entrepreneurship, digital products, copywriting, sales, funnels, marketing, and more. I‚Äôve discovered what I really care about in co-founders, and I‚Äôve met wonderful entrepreneurs from all around the world. People who might very well be key for my future successes.

I consider my entrepreneurial journey as a life-long learning experience. I‚Äôm only three years in and still have tons to learn, but I‚Äôm enjoying the journey. I‚Äôm not taking huge risks because I can‚Äôt. I have three kids to feed, a loan to pay, etc. And it‚Äôs all right. It‚Äôs just slower.

Reality is reality, but we can _interpret_ what we experience in various ways. I could focus on the failures, and I actually do from time to time, but I prefer to re-assess my reality as follows and to look at my path through the lens of growth.

So far, I‚Äôve not failed. I‚Äôve just been experimenting and discovered things that don‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve explored an alternative life and went far out of my comfort zone. More importantly, I‚Äôve exchanged big paychecks as a team/engineering lead with _a lot_ more freedom. Freedom to experiment with various ideas and freedom to decide where to go next. And that‚Äôs actually key. I did succeed. I have a ton more freedom than in my previous life.

When I started out, I was focused on getting at least as much money as I made as an employee. Now I realize that it doesn‚Äôt matter all that much to me. It‚Äôs much more fulfilling to wake up, knowing that I‚Äôm the captain of my boat. It may be small, but it‚Äôs _mine_. That‚Äôs why the steps I now take are all geared towards increasing my _freedom ratio_.

Now that I‚Äôve taken a bit of time to look back, I‚Äôm doing the second part of the exercise: thinking about my next moves. I‚Äôm not trying to think too far ahead though. Just like a [famous chess player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Znosko-Borovsky) once said: ‚Äú_It is not a move, even the best move that you must seek, but a realizable plan_‚Äù.

Anyhow; I‚Äôll tell you more about the future once I see it more clearly üòÇ

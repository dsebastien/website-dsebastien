I hope that this e-mail finds you well. I've decided to migrate from Mailchimp to <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/" rel="noopener">Revue</a>, so you'll probably notice some changes in the new edition!

## 4000 Weeks

This week I've been reminded that we only have ~4000 weeks to live, which means around 28000 days. I don't know about you, but it feels very little to me!

I've been here for almost 14000 days, so I've used half my time on earth. I've enjoyed my journey so far, and can't wait to discover what's next. One thing's for sure, we've got to make every day count! üòÑ

Keeping time in mind is a great way to move towards our goals in life. I do this all the time: I plan my days in advance, I set goals for myself for the week, and for months and years to come. Each and every day I define my main objective and do everything I can to focus on it. I also use the Pomodoro technique regularly and keep time visible using a time timer.

My goal isn't to stress myself about time or death, but just to try and make the best out of the time that I have.

## Recent articles

Last week, I've published a single article taken out of Dev Concepts. This article introduces one of the key skills for all Software Crafters: Problem-solving!

## Books corner

I've recently added ~200 books to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1464327?order=d&shelf=to-read&sort=date_added" rel="noopener">my "to-read" list on Goodreads</a> üòÇ. I've added tons of classics (fiction), but also many books that I find interesting around Personal Development, Mentoring, Coaching, Leadership, Business, Strategy, Product Management, UI/UX design, and more.

There are just so many interesting topics to explore! And that's exactly what I üòç about learning.

Here are some of the books I'm most eager to read in the coming months:

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Loving-What-Four-Questions-Change/dp/1400045371?tag=dsebastien00-20" rel="noopener">Loving What Is: Four Questions That Can Change Your Life</a>

  * It's very important to ask questions to others, but also to ask questions to ourselves. I hope that this book will help me to formulate the right ones.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Thousand-Weeks-Management-Mortals/dp/0374159122?tag=dsebastien00-20" rel="noopener">Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals</a>

  * Because I can never get enough of productivity and time management books. Each one has little nuggets to help us see time through a different lens.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-How-Good-Want/dp/0714843377?tag=dsebastien00-20" rel="noopener">It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want to Be</a>

  * I strongly believe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engelbart" rel="noopener">Engelbart's law</a> and self-improvement, so this book looks really appealing to me.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Brand-Identity-Essential-Branding/dp/1118980824?tag=dsebastien00-20" rel="noopener">Designing Brand Identity: An Essential Guide for the Whole Branding Team</a>

  * As I'm <a href="https://dsebastien.net/news/2021-07-23-edition-017" rel="noopener">building a new product</a>, I realize that my knowledge of branding is too limited. This book should help me improve in that domain.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Usability-Perception/dp/B00LLOMHZ0?tag=dsebastien00-20" rel="noopener">Universal Principles of Design</a>

  * Design is another area that I need to get better at. My hope is that by learning about the important concepts and principles, I'll be able to better express my ideas.

## Welcome to the 31st edition
Another week, another newsletter! I hope that you all had a great one ü§©

This week I‚Äôve started brainstorming with a new partner in crime. Andr√© and I are going to build a small Note-taking & productivity-centric app. Nothing earth-shattering, but this should be fun! üéâ
I‚Äôll tell you more in a week or two! Today, I‚Äôll just focus on the approach and my rationale.
Let‚Äôs dive in!

## Small and riskless bets

I have three short-term goals with the new app I‚Äôm working on:

-   Develop something small without needless pressure
-   Get to know Andr√© a little better and share knowledge/experiences
-   Get better at UX/UI design

It‚Äôs what I would call a **small and riskless bet**. Whatever happens, I won‚Äôt have ‚Äúlost‚Äù much money, and I‚Äôll have learned a thing or two along the way.

After having [lost 200K ‚Ç¨ due to opportunity cost](https://medium.com/swlh/20-months-in-2k-hours-spent-and-200k-lost-a-story-about-resilience-and-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-69fd4f61ef59) with my previous SaaS startup, I‚Äôve decided to be much less ambitious with new projects.

My reasoning is that small and riskless bets are the way to go. There‚Äôs no need to build a large and complex product right off the bat. The longer it takes to deliver a first ‚Äúsellable‚Äù version of a product, the riskier it is.

There are basically no upsides to building something big right away, apart from burning cash (which some people seem to enjoy doing):

-   It takes much longer and thus costs a lot more
-   It is much more complex
-   It pushes us to rigidify the way things work and thus become less Agile
-   Failing hurts a lot

Building something big right away is closely related to overconfidence. If we‚Äôre certain something is going to be a success, then we tend to go _all-in_. But the truth is that most startup projects fail. And when a project you‚Äôve put a ton of effort into fails, it hurts. It took me a long time to get back on my feet after I‚Äôve realized the project I had spent two thousand hours on was going nowhere.

Moreover, because of the [sunk cost fallacy](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/), it‚Äôs harder to let go of a failing project. Once you‚Äôve invested a lot of time, energy, and money into something, you don‚Äôt want to abandon it. You want to keep trying. Implement one more feature, fix one more bug. Hope one more day. But the longer it keeps going, the worse it gets!

Small and riskless bets are on the other side of the spectrum. With those, we invest little time, little money, and focus on moving fast. We still approach the work seriously and with all our energy, but we drastically reduce the risks involved.

With small and riskless bets, one can be bold and try many more things in much less time. It‚Äôs an approach that is actually recommended by successful entrepreneurs like [Sahil Lavingia](https://twitter.com/shl), the founder of Gumroad in [his latest book](https://www.amazon.com/Minimalist-Entrepreneur-Great-Founders-More/dp/034943140X?tag=dsebastien00-20) (which I‚Äôve recommended in the previous edition), and [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio). Pieter summarized it well with this tweet:

When you realize this, you can‚Äôt argue that making small bets is a much better way to go. We get to explore many more ideas in a much shorter time frame, and we can quickly sense what works and what doesn‚Äôt.

So, there you go, that‚Äôs my one piece of advice for today: don‚Äôt fall into the same trap as I did. Avoid being too ambitious right away. Instead, make small and riskless bets. Explore more ideas, and focus on getting those out the door as quickly as you can. That way, you‚Äôll invalidate your assumptions faster, and you‚Äôll be able to move on to the next project.

## Recent articles

This week I‚Äôve published two articles. The first one was a guest post by [Yennick Trevels](https://twitter.com/YennickT) a fellow software craftsman, who share his ideas about why craftsmanship matters. The second was an in-depth article about Angular 13, which has been released earlier this week.

## How cool is that?!

This one is for techies!

This week, a new feature has been announced for Lighthouse: user flows.

Previously, Lighthouse was only able to audit a single page. Now, we‚Äôre able to record complete user flows (e.g., login, search, add something to the cart, etc). Once a user flow has been recorded, Lighthouse can execute it and audit the performance of the whole flow.

This is a tremendous step forward, and it is the coolest thing I‚Äôve discovered this week!

You can learn more about it here: [https://web.dev/lighthouse-user-flows/](https://web.dev/lighthouse-user-flows/)

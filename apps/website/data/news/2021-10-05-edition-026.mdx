This week, my main reflections were about _time_ and _memories_. It all started with me watching [an episode](https://www.leisurebyte.com/netflix-explained-season-3-episode-12) of the Netflix documentary series called [Explained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explained_(TV_series)).

This episode, aptly named “Analyzing time” tried to explain what time _is_. I was mesmerized by it — maybe because it is narrated by [Joseph Gordon-Levitt](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Gordon-Levitt).

Time passes us by and, most of the time, we don’t even realize it. This reminded me of a timelapse video I made a few years ago when I was exploring electronics (I should probably resurrect that blog article):

<YouTube youTubeId="hEv9itCW8j0" />

The documentary starts with the experiment of [Michel Siffre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Siffre), a French geologist and underground explorer who wanted to contribute to the space race in some way. Mr. Siffre had the idea of [isolating himself underground for two whole months](https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/30/foer_siffre.php) in the [abyss of Scarasson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punta_Marguareis). It was a scientific survival experiment aiming to explore the physiological impact of living underground, without being exposed to sunlight for a long period of time. He only had a small electric light, no clocks, and was all alone the whole time. Michel was already very experienced by then; as a child (10-17), he did 150+ underground explorations. But that experiment was a first.

Our bodies have [internal clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm) that regulate our [biological rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronobiology). I find it quite fascinating that this is part of our DNA. The sun and its light have shaped us over millions of years.

One point from the documentary I want to focus on is the fact that time _feels_ different depending on our emotions. Sometimes we drive on autopilot and don’t remember doing so. Sometimes hours go by in a jiffy because we’re super engaged in what we’re doing. Sometimes weeks and months disappear in an instant without leaving traces behind. And sometimes it’s the polar opposite; each minute we’re waiting for important news feels like forever. [Emotions heavily influence our sense of time](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2011.00058/full).

After his experiment, Michel Siffre realized that his estimates of how much time had passed were far off. It took him five minutes to count to 120. His sense of time was completely messed up. [His explanation](https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/30/foer_siffre.php) for this is the fact that _memory does not capture the time when there are no important moments_. During his time underground, days & nights were all the same. Nothing much happened: wake up in the dark, spend the day in the dark, go to sleep, repeat.

In the documentary, they went on to compare that experiment with the Covid lockdowns around the world, which have also distorted the sense of time for most of us.

This reminded me of the [boring work routine](https://medium.com/management-matters/going-back-to-work-no-thank-you-5429d60acd12). Days and weeks go unnoticed if we don’t pay attention. And here’s the thing. Routine is great for productivity, but it’s important for us to create memories for ourselves and to really live the moment. When we focus entirely on work and productivity, we skew our internal clocks and miss important moments of life.

I wanted to write about this because now that my son is at home with us, I take every occasion to be present, without distractions, to make that time truly memorable.

To conclude, I want to recommend an awesome movie about time (no, not Back to the Future, sorry :p): [About Time](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/).

## Dev Concepts progress

This week I’ve finally launched the [new landing page](https://www.dev-concepts.dev/) of Dev Concepts. It took me a few days to craft it, but I’m happy with the results. Now I hope that more people will get to discover the project!

## Books corner

This week I want to share a book that has strongly influenced the way I manage my personal finances.

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Need-Budget-Paycheck-Paycheck/dp/0062567586?tag=dsebastien00-20" rel="noopener">You Need a Budget: The Proven System for Breaking the Paycheck-to-Paycheck Cycle, Getting Out of Debt, and Living the Life You Want</a>

  * This book describes the methodology behind a tool called [YouNeedABudget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (YNAB), and I can’t recommend it enough.

## Welcome to the 28th edition

Another week, another newsletter! I hope that you all had a great one.

Today, my son Rapha√´l is officially one month old. Now that he‚Äôs born, he can open his eyes and discover the world. He sees us, hears us more clearly, interacts with us, and evolves very quickly. For instance, he started gazing at us a few days ago. Before that, he squinted a lot and did not eye-track. It took him some time to learn to properly use his eyes.

The funny thing is that he was supposed to be born only in a few days (October 21st!). This got me thinking‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve been wondering about the impact that being born prematurely has on his development. If he was still in the womb of his mother, he wouldn‚Äôt have experienced all of that. So, in a way, not only is he born earlier, but he gets to experience the world differently a month sooner. Anyhow, this reminds me that I really want to dive into neuroscience one of these days! üòÇ

## Web3

Web3 has been all the rage on Twitter recently, to a point where it almost eclipsed the JavaScript noise, which is impressive, to say the least.

I was curious, so I‚Äôve participated in a [one-hour workshop](https://lu.ma/web3?) about Web3 organized by [Orbit](https://orbit.love/?).

The workshop was led by [The Web 3.0 Girl](https://twitter.com/seemcat?), who did a great job at explaining the key parts.

First, how Web3 relates to Web 1.0 and 2.0:

Then the core components:

-   Blockchains
-   dApps: Applications that run on blockchain networks
-   Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): owning and using our identity and data
-   Cryptocurrencies

And finally, the core tenets:

Web3 is about decentralization, as well as the free flow of information and value. It‚Äôs about moving away from intermediaries that hold/control both our data and applications (e.g., Google and other FAANG like Microsoft, Amazon, etc). It‚Äôs about breaking silos and creating more transparent organizations and communities.

Our personal data is currently held by huge corporations as well as dozens of SaaS businesses that aren‚Äôt transparent at all and whose incentives are not necessarily aligned with our best interests. We‚Äôre using free services, but in exchange we give up our privacy, lose control over our own information, and end up being stuck with vendors that have their own agendas.

One key aspect is that data/information silos limit innovation. While that creates business opportunities for integration solutions like Zapier, it also makes our lives more complicated than necessary and makes our workflows rely on often brittle integration layers.

Interestingly, the [SOLID project of Tim Berners Lee](https://solid.mit.edu/) that I‚Äôve been following since the early days is actually part of the ‚ÄúWeb3 movement‚Äù, as it aims to decouple data from the applications that manipulate it.

I‚Äôm super enthusiastic about the ideas behind Web3. There‚Äôs no doubt that Web3 is not a fad. It‚Äôll have an important impact on the IT industry, the creator economy (e.g., shared ownership, community-oriented creation, the democratization of wealth and success, etc), and the whole world.

I‚Äôm by no means an expert, but I‚Äôm curious and want to factor in ideas about Web3 into my next projects.

If you don‚Äôt know anything about Web3 yet and the potential it holds for the future, then check out [the recording of the session](https://app.butter.us/recording/3e3dc1a3-bc3c-436d-be99-bf9e6b542449). Note that the Miro board that was used is also [publicly available](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lq3PGEc=/).

## Recent articles

I did not publish anything new this week, but I want to remind you about best practices around code comments. If you write code, then learn to write great comments:

* How to write code comments like a pro: https://itnext.io/how-to-write-code-comments-like-a-pro-c830e68cec92

  * In this article, I‚Äôll explain how my commenting practice (yes, that‚Äôs a thing :p) has evolved as well as what I currently recommend, whether you‚Äôre a junior fresh out of school, a seasoned developer‚Ä¶

Also, in case you‚Äôve missed it, here‚Äôs a Twitter thread that I shared a while ago about the downsides of microservices: https://twitter.com/dSebastien/status/1390693510341447688?

## How cool is that?!

Here‚Äôs a new idea for the newsletter. In this section, I‚Äôll try to share one thing that amazed me recently on the Web. It may be code, it may be a game, it may be an idea.
This week, it‚Äôs how people can be creative, even with something as basic as HTML checkboxes:

* Checkboxland: https://www.bryanbraun.com/checkboxland/?

  * Render anything using HTML checkboxes
* DOOM via Checkboxes: https://healeycodes.github.io/doom-checkboxes/?

  * WebAssembly meets 16000 HTML checkboxes.
* Windows Task Manager Runs Doom (896 cores): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSoCmAoIMOU
  * Yes, it‚Äôs also possible to play Doom using the Windows task manager. Obvious, right?! üòÇ

## Tips of the week

* How to enable auto-correct for Git commands: https://andy-carter.com/blog/auto-correct-git-commands?

  * A configuration setting for Git to let it autocorrect commands.
* Top 10 Chrome Flags That You Should Enable: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-chrome-flags-that-you-should-enable/?

  * Chrome has many flags. Some are experiments that will become stable, others will disappear, but many are worth taking a look at!
* Grab HTML input value as number or date: https://twitter.com/Stegosource/status/1447307778620628994

  * A little known API of HTML input elements.

## Books corner

At the moment, I‚Äôm mostly reading non-fiction. But I do read fiction on the back burner (~10-20 minutes a day). I enjoy reading many authors, but in recent years the two that I read the most are Stephen King and Dean Koontz.
Currently, I‚Äôm reading this one by Dean Koontz:

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Watchers-Dean-Koontz/dp/0425221806?tag=dsebastien00-20&" rel="noopener">Watchers</a>

  * On the benefits of doing nothing. From time to time, obviously.

## Quote of the week

> Eighty percent of success is showing up (Woody Allen)

> If you have always done it that way, it is probably wrong (Charles Kettering)

> Be yourself; everyone else is already taken (Oscar Wilde)

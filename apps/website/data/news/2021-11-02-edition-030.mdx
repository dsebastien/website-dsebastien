## Welcome to the 30th edition
Another week, another newsletter! I hope that you all had a great one ü§©

Thirty sounds like a nice milestone. I certainly thought so when I hit that age. I was scared at first, but it went all right. I‚Äôm nearing the next decade already! But, for now, I‚Äôm trying not to think about it too much. I don‚Äôt want to feel too wise just yet.

I am deeply sorry but there won‚Äôt be any major insights about the meaning of life and the universe this time around üòÇ. Although, I do have a few things to share with you.

Let‚Äôs dive in!

## Neurodiversity
One thing I want to put forward this week is the importance and value of being open to and supportive of neurodiversity. We‚Äôre all different, and that‚Äôs _fine_. There‚Äôs no need for us all to function in the same way. That would actually be super boring!

As a kid, neurodiversity wasn‚Äôt something I was particularly aware of. I thought of differences as _flaws_.

The first time I stopped being utterly stupid about it was when I discovered [‚ÄúLe Huiti√®me Jour‚Äù (The Eighth Day)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116581), a fantastic French movie about the friendship between a busy/unhappy salesman played by [Daniel Auteuil](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000809) and an institutionalized man with [Down syndrome](https://prahs.com/insights/shining-a-spotlight-on-down-syndrome-through-education-advocacy-and-research), played by [Pascal Duquenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Duquenne). I was deeply moved by it, and can‚Äôt recommend it enough (Go watch it now!). It really opened my eyes.

Later, when I was a teenager, my parents decided to become a host family. Three children joined us, and my parents adopted them later on. The first was my sister Ana√Øs who has mental retardation. She joined us when she was still a baby. Even though she has her differences, she‚Äôs also the most joyful person I know. When I get her on the phone, I know that I can make her laugh in about two seconds. And that is truly priceless. She‚Äôs innocent. She works differently, and it causes her issues in life. But she‚Äôs also a wonderful and kind human being. Many people on this earth could learn a thing or two from her.

More recently, my daughter Amandine was diagnosed with ADHD. It was actually a relief for us to discover that and learn more about the way she functions. Since then we‚Äôve been able to help her. It‚Äôs not always easy though. We have to be creative to find ways to channel her energy üòÇ.

As I get older, I realize how much society still stigmatizes differences, and it‚Äôs really sad. That‚Äôs why I was glad to read Jan De Wilde‚Äôs article this week: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hi-im-what-i-think-jan-de-wilde/

I find it inspiring when people dare to put words forward, and share a bit of their personal life. And Jan‚Äôs success in life shows that diversity doesn‚Äôt mean weakness; far from it!

Whenever you have a chance to, stand up for neurodiverse people. They‚Äôre also wonderful people ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Recent articles

This week I‚Äôve published an article about evening routines. I‚Äôve tried to articulate the benefits of having a clearly defined shutdown routine. I‚Äôve also shared my own 4-stages approach.

* Practice an evening routine to feel better every day: https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-10-25-evening-routine

  * Learn about the benefits of defining a clear evening routine to improve your well-being.

## How cool is that?!

If you don‚Äôt know a thing about Photoshop, let me tell you one: Photoshop is one of the most complex pieces of software in existence. Seeing it become a Web Application is massively impressive. It shows how much the Web has evolved in recent years!
While I‚Äôm at it, take a look at Photopea, which is a free Photoshop clone. What is crazy with that one is that it replicates a big part of what Photoshop can do. Even more so is the fact that there‚Äôs a single developer behind it! That guy‚Äôs a genius.

* Photoshop's journey to the web: https://web.dev/ps-on-the-web/

  * Over the last three years, Chrome has been working to empower web applications that want to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in the browser. One such web application has been Photoshop.
* Photopea, an advanced photo editor: https://www.photopea.com/

## Books corner


Even though I‚Äôm super tired, I‚Äôve managed to read two short books this week. Those are non-fiction books written by Austin Kleon. I really enjoyed both of them. If you‚Äôre a creator or an aspiring one, then check those out, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

My favorite was ‚ÄúSteal Like An Artist‚Äù, which is really packed with tons of useful advice and insights. I kept putting the book down to capture highlights. It‚Äôll take me a while to get through those notes ;)

Since I‚Äôm sharing inspiring books for creators, I also want to mention [Sahil Lavingia](https://twitter.com/shl)‚Äòs brand new creation, ‚ÄúThe Minimalist Entrepreneur‚Äù. Sahil is the founder and CEO of [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/), a wildly successful digital marketplace. Besides being a wonderful human being, Sahil is also a business leader with a [fascinating vision of what success means](https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting). If you haven‚Äôt [read his blog](https://sahillavingia.com/), then you‚Äôre missing out!

## Welcome to the 27th edition

Another week, another newsletter! I hope that you all had a great one.
This week I‚Äôve spent a surprising amount of time changing diapers‚Ä¶ and thinking about life (nope, those are not mutually exclusive!).

## Community building


This week, I‚Äôve participated in the ‚ÄúBefore Community‚Äù [learning sprint organized by Orbit](https://lu.ma/Before-Community).

Rosie has been [building communities](https://rosie.land) for [many years](https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/how-i-built-an-80k-mo-business-by-listening-to-my-audience-596212dcdc) now, so it was a treat to have her teach us about her craft. The [results of the workshop are accessible here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ltNAuD8=/) for free. It‚Äôs really worth a look! If you‚Äôre interested, then I‚Äôll share my notes.

Creating online communities was not a skill that I planned on acquiring, but the more I think about it, the more I‚Äôm realizing that it‚Äôs a valuable skill to learn, so I‚Äôm diving right in!

If some of you are interested, then I‚Äôll share my notes. I hope to leverage the things I‚Äôve learned in order to better shape the two communities I‚Äôve created recently:

-   The [Personal Knowledge Management community](https://dsebastien.net/pkm-community)
-   The [Software Crafters community](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-08-25-software-crafters-community)

If you‚Äôre curious about community building, then check out the upcoming events that Orbit is organizing:

Orbit also has a nice [Discord server](https://discord.orbit.love/).

## Svelte

<Tweet tweetLink="dSebastien/status/1446385276419518491" />

After hesitating a bit, I‚Äôve finally decided to start learning more about [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). I‚Äôm just getting started, but what I‚Äôve discovered so far looks really promising. I like the simplicity and the [interactive tutorials](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics).

As some of you know, I‚Äôm a huge fan of [Nrwl NX](https://nx.dev), so the first thing I did was look for a Svelte plugin. Fortunately, [Dominik Pieper](https://twitter.com/dominik_pieper) has got me covered. He has created [@nxext/svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nxext/svelte), which is a breeze to [install and configure](https://nxext.dev/docs/svelte/installation). Thanks to it, I was quickly able to add a Svelte application to my Nx workspace. Neat!

Next, I wanted to add [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/) to the mix, because there‚Äôs no going back for me; Tailwind is a must now. I found a [documentation page](https://nxext.dev/docs/svelte/examples/custom-preprocessor-config) by Dominik which showed me one possible way, but I didn‚Äôt want to hide away my PostCSS config, so I looked for other options. I ended up creating [a template](https://github.com/dsebastien/svelte-tailwind-nx-template):

<Tweet tweetLink="dSebastien/status/1447202780989509633" />

I‚Äôll write an article to explain the few steps required to get started.
My next step is to continue exploring the documentation and create a Chrome extension to do something concrete while learning.
If there‚Äôs interest, I could maybe try and stream my explorations on Youtube. You‚Äôd get to see the gazillions of silly things I try while learning new things ;-)

## Recent articles

This week I‚Äôve published a lengthy article (~20min read) about periodic journaling & daily note-taking:

* How periodic journaling can lead to a more fulfilling life - Part 1: https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-10-07-periodic-journaling-part-1
* How periodic journaling can lead to a more fulfilling life - Part 2: https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-10-07-periodic-journaling-part-2

It may sound silly, but journaling & periodic reviews are really transformative. Both play an important role in my productivity system. Do you also keep a journal? If not, why? What‚Äôs keeping you from keeping track of what happens in your life?

## Tips of the week

* 5 steps to designing the life you want (TED Talk by Bill Burnett): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SemHh0n19LA

## Books corner

This week I want to share a book that I‚Äôm curious about. As a workaholic, I certainly need to dive into this one re-learn the art of doing nothing without feeling guilty ;-)

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Do-Nothing-Resisting-Attention/dp/1612198554?tag=dsebastien00-20" rel="noopener">How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy</a>

  * On the benefits of doing nothing. From time to time, obviously.

## Quote of the week

> Life is about ‚ÄúWanting what you get‚Äù, not ‚ÄúGetting what you want‚Äù

> If it‚Äôs not actionable, it‚Äôs not a problem, it‚Äôs a circumstance

> The mind has no firewall

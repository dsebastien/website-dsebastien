## The Next Waves

Last week I mentioned that we all have roughly <a href="https://dsebastien.net/news/2021-09-14-edition-023?utm_campaign=DeveloPassion%27s%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" rel="noopener">four thousand weeks at our disposal</a> to live a happy life and make the world a better place. It‚Äôs funny to me to think that I‚Äôm halfway through this journey as my newborn son is right at the beginning.

He‚Äôs going to grow in a world that is _radically_ different from the one I joined when I was born back in 1983; it makes me feel soooo old ;-)

By the time he‚Äôs 20 (2041!), the world will surely have changed a lot, as the rate of innovation <a href="https://dsebastien.net/news/2021-08-01-edition-018?utm_campaign=DeveloPassion%27s%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" rel="noopener">continues to accelerate</a>. That thought is mesmerizing!

I grew in a world where the Internet was brand new. Most families I knew did not have access to it. Adults didn‚Äôt know much and most didn‚Äôt care at all. When I was around 10, I remember telling my mom: ‚ÄúThe Internet is going to change _everything_‚Äù. My mother laughed; she didn‚Äôt get it. Truth is that the world was already changing, but it was far from obvious to many. And I guess the same is true nowadays. The world changes constantly, often without us paying attention.

A few years back, desktop applications were much more important than they are today. The Web platform has evolved so much in the last years that we‚Äôre now able to build replacements for most desktop applications. We use the Web and Web applications a whole lot more than desktop applications, and most of those are slowly fading away, either replaced by native functionality or by SaaS. I remember keeping an entire collection of software on my NAS; tools for communications, drivers, utilities, etc. Most of those are bogus now.

We used to own our music. I grew with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape" rel="noopener">cassette tapes</a> and spent countless hours recording songs on the radio. Later I copied CDs and DVDs. It took hours and hours to burn those. Nero was king at the time (those who used it will get this :p). My car was packed with music CDs, and my NAS was full of MP3 and FLAC albums (ah the good old days :p). I spent entire nights filling the metadata so that everything would be perfect. I listened to far-away radio stations on SHOUTcast and the like. And now we have tools like Shazam, we have connected cars with Internet access, we can stream music, etc.

When I was young, I didn‚Äôt have much choice about what content to consume. We put the TV on, and the only choice was what was broadcasting at that time. When I was ~14, I realized that the Internet would give me choice. And I stopped watching TV forever. I chose what I wanted to watch, and what I wanted to discover. For some time, we rented DVD movies, but then downloaded movie rips, and exchanged hard drives full of movies and music with our friends. We used to exchange a ton more files, used FTP servers to host those and share data (or even DCC, newsgroups, and the like for those who remember). During LAN parties we would bring our 22" monitors along with our maxi towers to play Half-Life and Counter-Strike for a weekend. The network would saturate because of all the ongoing file transfers. Then the age of peer-to-peer came, and the world started exchanging terabytes of information instead. Then, as technologies evolved and Internet bandwidth increased across the globe, our usage patterns evolved. What would before take an hour to download now takes mere seconds. Game developers stopped compressing assets and videogames now use 100GB of disk space. It‚Äôs completely _crazy_.

As everything accelerated, streaming services appeared one after another and slowly replaced our past solutions. Gone are the days where we needed to search for or fix movie subtitles. Now we get Spotify, Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and we have access to countless hours of content.

We used to chat on IRC, then we used tools like ICQ, MSN, Skype, and now we drown in communication channels. We have Messenger, Whatsapp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Teams, Hangouts, Zoom, and a dozen more that we need to use in parallel to discuss with friends, family, coworkers, and communities that we are a part of. Information overload has been a real challenge for a while, and now we also have a communication channel overload.

We now have GPS, WiFi, 4G/5G, Bluetooth, contactless payments, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, RFIDs, drones, smart contracts, and so many other cool technologies at our disposal. The Internet is everywhere, deeply integrated with many things in our lives. We live in a world that is always getting more connected.

The first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism" rel="noopener">space tourists</a> have visited the ISS, we‚Äôve sent robots to explore Mars, and the next step for humanity is to colonize the planet. I have mixed feelings about space tourism, but I‚Äôm super enthusiastic about space exploration. Space; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_no_man_has_gone_before" rel="noopener">the final frontier</a>‚Ä¶ ‚ú®

And I could go on and on. Innovation changes the world faster than ever. Needless to say, the World Wide Web really has changed everything. For all of us. There are now countless opportunities for us to learn, share, and grow. Education has never been as accessible, and it keeps getting better. The tools at our disposal are also getting more powerful. I‚Äôm in awe when I think about the <a href="https://www.fastprint.co.uk/blog/the-evolution-of-photoshop-25-years-in-the-making.html" rel="noopener">evolution of tools like Photoshop</a>. And now there‚Äôs a new revolution ongoing: <a href="https://dsebastien.net/news/2021-09-05-edition-022" rel="noopener">tools for thought are on the rise</a>! I have high hopes for the future of education.

This reminds me of an interesting play of words in French:

> A l‚Äô√©cole on nous apprend le pass√© simple mais jamais le futur compliqu√©, ce qui serait un joli pr√©sent pour affronter tout ce qui est imparfait. Et tout √ßa alors que c'est un besoin imp√©ratif! En conclusion: Oublie ton pass√©, qu‚Äôil soit simple ou compos√©, et participe √† ton pr√©sent pour que ton futur soit plus-que-parfait.

Each crisis shows us that there‚Äôs good in humanity. Humanity has a bright future. Paved with challenges for sure, but I‚Äôm enthusiastic for my children, and can‚Äôt think of a better time to welcome my son Rapha√´l to discover the wonders of this world and all the surprises that the future holds.
I wonder what the next thousand weeks will look like. What I‚Äôm certain of is that I‚Äôll enjoy each and every day, and I‚Äôll do my best to help my children become awesome human beings! ‚ù§Ô∏è

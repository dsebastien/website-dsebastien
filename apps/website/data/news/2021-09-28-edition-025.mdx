This week has come and gone without me noticing. I‚Äôve spent my days in a constant rush, taking care of the children, doing roundtrips between home and the hospital, and doing laundry üòÇ. But it‚Äôs over now, Rapha√´l and his mother are home with us. Home sweet home! ‚ú®

## Sleep deprivation

Now that Rapha√´l is back home with us, sleep is a thing of the past. For a couple of weeks (at best), I‚Äôm going to sleep intermittently 3-4 hours per night (at most). It‚Äôs going to be tough, but it‚Äôs not the first time around for me. I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm used to it, but I‚Äôve been there and survived, somehow üòÇ
One thing is for sure, sleep deprivation has devastating effects on the brain. Even after a single night, I already feel that my brain is going in slow motion, and I feel super irritable.

For me, the worst part of sleep deprivation is the feeling of emptiness it creates. When you finally manage to get up you have zero energy, ideas don‚Äôt flow, and everything seems annoying.

I have to put my morning routine on hold for a while. If I try to set the alarm clock at 5:30 as usual, I just won‚Äôt wake up. And even if I do, I won‚Äôt have energy and won‚Äôt be productive.

It‚Äôs tough because my habits are well established, and I hate to lose momentum. But it‚Äôs good to take a step away from the treadmill once in a while to fully taste precious moments in life. In the coming weeks, I‚Äôm mostly going to admire my son, read as much as I can, and maybe play the remastered version of Diablo 2 üòÑ

## Recent articles

Once again, I didn‚Äôt publish anything new this week. This feels so frustrating! But don‚Äôt worry, this won‚Äôt last long.

## Books corner

This week I want to share a book that I‚Äôm really eager to read:

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Replacing-Guilt-Minding-Our-Way/dp/B086FTSB3Q?tag=dsebastien00-20" rel="noopener">Replacing Guild: Minding Our Way</a>

  * This book explores the vague feeling of guilt we sometimes feel when we‚Äôre unproductive. In recent years. I‚Äôm curious about this one because I‚Äôve actually trained myself to almost resent being unproductive. This also reminded me of an <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/productivity-vs-guilt-and-selfloathing" rel="noopener">old article by Scott Hanselman</a>

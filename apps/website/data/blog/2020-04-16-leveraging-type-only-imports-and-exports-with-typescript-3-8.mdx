A few months back, I started seeing strange warnings in Webpack about exports that could not be found.

I was puzzled. Obviously, there was something wrong, since the export was really there:

<Gist gistLink="dsebastien/f542e2b00a3be272c4ad58ace37b50ce" />

And I couldn’t notice what was wrong where I was using that type:

<Gist gistLink="dsebastien/db4f8516ece24de8afe61ee2e99eab81" />

Can you spot the problem?

## The root cause…

After digging for a little while without having a clue, I’ve stumbled on the following issue: [https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/7378](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/7378)

I had a feeling it has something to do with TypeScript & transpilation, since I was importing/using a TypeScript type, but it wasn’t clear…

And then it clicked; [Tobias Koppers immediately saw](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/7378#issuecomment-392264102) what I failed to understand. I was “ashamed” since I had just [published a book about TypeScript](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-TypeScript-Building-Applications-understanding-ebook/dp/B081FB89BL?tag=dsebastien00-20) :D

The thing is that once TypeScript code is transpiled, interfaces/types are gone. They don’t exist anymore; they don’t exist in the _emitted_ files.

What I didn’t think much about before is that while the types are erased, the imports/exports aren’t necessarily. The reason is that there are ambiguities and that the compiler doesn’t always know for sure whether something that is exported is a type or a value.

In my particular case, what Webpack saw when it processed the resulting JavaScript code is that an import was there for something that didn’t exist.

Webpack was lenient, so it only emitted a warning, but the issue was indeed really there and I had no control over what TypeScript generated in that case.

## TypeScript 3.8 to the rescue

I didn’t have much time to look further into the issue at that point, so I let it rest for a while (it wasn’t blocking), but later, once TypeScript 3.8 was released, I noticed something really interesting in the release notes: [Type-Only Imports and Exports](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8/#type-only-imports-exports).

It directly reminded me of my import issue…

This new feature of TypeScript added the possibility to import an element only as a type, precisely for cases where a type is imported only to be used as a type and never as a value. And this was exactly what I needed; thanks to this I could finally tell the compiler precisely what I wanted to do.

To fix the problem, I simply had to replace this

```
import { MyCustomExpressRequest } from "../../../shared";
```

By the following:

```
import type { DidowiExpressRequest } from "../../../shared";
```

Wonderful!

But what does this change in practice?

Well, as the [TS release notes](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8/#type-only-imports-exports) explain, by importing an element using “import type”, it tells the compiler that the element is only imported to be used as a type annotation/declaration. Thanks to this, the compiler knows that it can erase the import in the emitted code.

With this single change done, Webpack was immediately happier: no more weird imports!

Note that you can also use `export type` to indicate that some export will only ever be used as a type annotation/declaration.

Finally, the behavior can be further configured through the `importsNotUsedAsValues` flag.

## Conclusion

TypeScript Type-Only imports/exports are a useful addition to the language, allowing us to have more fine-grained control over what TypeScript does for us, hence allowing us to handle some annoying “edge cases” like this one.

A word of warning though: don’t go overboard with this ;-)

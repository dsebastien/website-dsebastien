## One more community? Why?

I've decided to create an online community for Software Crafters. Here's what it's all about!

There are countless communities out there, on Slack, Discord, Reddit, etc. But I don't think that there are many dedicated to people who consider themselves as "artisans of code".

I want to create that space because I'm sure that I'm not alone and that many people share the same passion for IT and Software Development.

Considering IT & software development as a craft doesn't mean focusing on code quality more than business outcomes, on the contrary. But it does mean not losing sight of technical debt, and the risks/costs it incurs.

## How to join?

If you think of yourself as a crafter, then come join us on Slack, where we'll discuss best practices around code quality, testing, security, software design, IT architecture, and more!

Here's the invite link: https://join.slack.com/t/softwarecrafterstalk/shared_invite/zt-umgx3v06-4rtJ20PXz867GTPzCk1zeQ

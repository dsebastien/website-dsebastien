In this article, I want to introduce the [Personal Knowledge Management Library](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/PersonalKnowledgeManagementLibrary), a project that I officially launched at the end of 2021.

## The modern world is overwhelming
Every day, we get bombarded with information. There's always more, and it's getting worse. We need ways to organize ourselves and our information. Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is a way to stay on top of it all. Armed with a properly designed PKM system, we can avoid feeling overwhelmed.

But what is a PKM system and how to design one? Well that's the main question the [PKM Library](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/PersonalKnowledgeManagementLibrary) is there to help you with.

I've been passionate about information, knowledge management, and PKM for more than 20 years. As a knowledge worker, author, blogger, and entrepreneur, I needed solutions to store and organize an enormous amount of information.

Recently, the Personal Knowledge Management space has evolved a lot with the rise of tools such as Notion, Obsidian, Roam Research, LogSeq, and others. Those have drastically changed the knowledge management landscape and brought us the opportunity to manage knowledge much more efficiently

## What is the Personal Knowledge Management Library?

During most of 2021, I've done extensive research and curated a ton of information and links about the Personal Knowledge Management space. I've regrouped all of this inside of a Notion space. It is now a solid database of the best resources you can find on the subject around the Internet. It's one of the most comprehensive resources you can find on the Web today.

As I'm writing this, the PKM Library is composed of:

* Links to 220+ articles
* Links to 120+ videos
* A list of 150+ tools
* A list of 55+ books about learning, thinking, note-taking, journaling, neuroscience, etc
* Links to 150+ sites & blogs
* A list of 50+ YouTube channels
* A list of 50+ courses
* A list of 50+ newsletters
* A list of 40+ communities and forums
* A list of ~1.2K PKM leaders, influencers, and enthusiasts
* A list of 40+ starter kits and templates
* A list of 20+ Twitter hashtags to follow
* A list of 10+ podcasts

Importantly, week after week, I keep adding resources to the PKM Library, as I continue to explore and learn more.

## Where can I get it?
The [PKM Library](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/PersonalKnowledgeManagementLibrary) is available on [Gumroad](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/PersonalKnowledgeManagementLibrary).

That's it for today! âœ¨

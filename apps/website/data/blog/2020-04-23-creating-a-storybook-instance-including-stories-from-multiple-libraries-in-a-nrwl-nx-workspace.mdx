Here’s a really short article about a cool trick that I’ve learned by reading a discussion on the [Nx support slack channel](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/1739).

In a [Nrwl N](https://nx.dev/)x workspace, when you add [Storybook support](https://nx.dev/angular/plugins_storybook/overview), what you get by default is a separate instance of [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for each feature library.

This is nice as it allows to quickly spin up a Storybook instance, loaded with only a subset of the stories related to a specific feature/group of features. Main benefit: focus, startup time → perfect for development and [e2e testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C88th0SbepE).

In some cases though, you might also want to be able to see stories from multiple or even all of your libraries, together in a single Storybook instance.

[Juri Strumpflohner](https://twitter.com/juristr) has [shared the simple recipe on Github](https://github.com/juristr/nx-shared-storybook); here’s how it works!

## TLDR;

If you know how all of this works, then simply follow these steps:

- Create a shared library with normal Nx Storybook support (i.e., library with a .storybook folder, angular.json configuration with a “storybook” and “build-storybook” target
- Modify the config.js file under `libs/<your new library>/.storybook)` to replace the `configure(...)` line with `configure(require.context(“../../”, true, /\.stories\.tsx?$/), module);`

Run storybook against your library and enjoy.

## The (slightly) longer version

As I’ve explained in [one of my previous articles](https://medium.com/@dSebastien/adding-tailwind-support-to-a-nrwl-nx-workspace-with-angular-and-storybook-bf890ea882e), when Storybook is added in n Nx workspace through the Nx CLI, Nx adds a “.storybook” folder at the root of the workspace, but also within each library that is configured for Storybook.

Inside of the .storybook folder of each library, there’s a config.js file which can be used to customize the configuration of Storybook for a specific library.

The default configuration instructs Storybook to load all “.stories.ts(x)” files in the current library; it looks as follows:

```typescript
import { configure } from '@storybook/angular';

configure(require.context('../src/lib', true, /\.stories\.tsx?$/), module);
```

As you can see, it only looks for stories within the library’s src/lib folder.

So finding and loading libraries from other libraries is actually as simple as changing the above _require.context_ path to look for Stories in the whole “libs” folder (and most certainly works just as well for React apps).

Of course you don’t want to do this on one of your existing libraries; it’s preferable to create a dedicated library for this. In [his example](https://github.com/juristr/nx-shared-storybook), Juri has created a dedicated [library called “storybook” under “libs/shared”](https://github.com/juristr/nx-shared-storybook/tree/master/libs/shared/storybook).

By the way, note that you can use a different port for this Storybook instance by adapting your angular.json file.

## Conclusion

This was a really short piece, but I found it quite nice and interesting to write a few words about it. Thanks to Juri for sharing the idea! ;-)

If you’re also diving into Storybook, Nx (and/or Angular), then don’t hesitate to look at my [other articles](https://medium.com/@dSebastien/adding-tailwind-support-to-a-nrwl-nx-workspace-with-angular-and-storybook-bf890ea882e) on the [subject](https://medium.com/@dSebastien/using-ngx-translate-in-storybook-stories-3f4228f80e02).

That’s it for today!

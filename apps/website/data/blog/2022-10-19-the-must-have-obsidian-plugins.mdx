In this article, I'll list my favorite plugins for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Most of those are part of my [Obsidian Starter Kit](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit).

## Introduction

Obsidian has a really large community and a huge library of community plugins. Those plugins really add a lot of value to Obsidian and make for a much better user experience. Exploring those can be daunting as there are [hundreds](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/plugins) (600+ at the time of writing). Let me spare you some time and introduce you to the very best plugins out there!

## Built-in plugins
Obsidian comes out of the box with a set of "core" plugins that are disabled by default. You can enable/disable those through the options, under "Core plugins". Many of those are super useful.

Here's a short overview:

* Audio recorder: easily record audio from Obsidian and add the recording as attachment
* Backlinks: show links from other notes to the current one
* Command palette: hit "Cmd/Ctrl + P" to show the palette and quickly execute commands
* Daily notes: create or open today's daily note. I don't recommend this plugin because the "Periodic Notes" plugin discussed later in this article is much more powerful
* File explorer: see the files and folders in the vault
* File recovery: recover files
* Format converter: convert Markdown from other applications to Obsidian's own format
* Graph view: View a graph that displays links between notes
* Notes composer: manipulate notes (merge, split, refactor)
* Outgoing links: show links from the current note to other ones. Also detects unlinked mentions
* Outline: display the outline of the current note
* Page preview: preview the content of links by pressing Ctrl/Cmd while hovering those
* Publish: publish notes through Obsidian Publish
* Quick switcher: Use "Ctrl/Cmd + O" to navigate between notes
* Random note
* Search
* Slash commands: Allows triggering commands by typing "/" in the editor
* Starred: star frequently used files and searches
* Sync: synchronize files using Obsidian Sync
* Tag pane: display your tags and their number of occurrences
* Templates: insert templates. This one is great, but the "Templater" plugin discussed afterwards is much more powerful
* Word count: display the word count

## Calendar
This plugin adds a useful calendar to the sidebar of Obsidian. It provides a simple way to navigate between your daily notes. I use it all the time instead of navigating through the file tree. At a glance, you can see the days for which you have taken daily notes. The second use case of this plugin is to easily create a future daily note. This is useful when you want to add a reminder for yourself.

## Periodic notes
Using the periodic notes plugin, you can easily create periodic notes (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly notes).

You can associate a specific template with each periodicity (e.g. a template for daily notes, another for weekly notes, etc). This plugin is also well integrated with the calendar plugin above. When you click on a date in the calendar, it creates the corresponding daily note.

With this plugin, [journaling](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-10-07-periodic-journaling-part-1) is much easier to do on a regular basis, and so are weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly [periodic reviews](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2022-05-16-periodic-reviews).

## Rollover daily todos
If your list of tasks for the day is part of your daily notes (which I recommend), then this plugin is a must-have. It will automatically copy the incomplete tasks to the list of the next day. This makes it a breeze to continue where you left things off.

## Dataview
Dataview is the most powerful Obsidian plugin there is. Using it, you can add queries to your notes to fetch information from your knowledge base.

To give you an idea of how powerful it is, take a look at these examples, taken directly from the [Obsidian Starter Kit](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit):

Find quotes corresponding to a specific author:

```javascript
LIST FROM #quotes and [[<% tp.file.title %>]]
SORT file.name ASC
```

Find recently modified notes:

```javascript
$=dv.list(dv.pages('').sort(f=>f.file.mtime.ts,"desc").limit(5).file.link)
```

Find orphan notes:

```javascript
TABLE file.ctime AS "updated"
FROM "" WHERE length(file.inlinks) = 0
AND length(file.outlinks) = 0
AND length(file.tags) = 0
AND file.name != "Orphans"
SORT file.mtime desc
```

Find duplicate notes:

```javascript
// Reference: https://github.com/claremacrae/obsidian-experiments-plugin/issues/1#issuecomment-1139556976
function listFileNameIssues(dv) {
    let pages = dv.pages();
    let groups = pages.groupBy(p => p.file.name.toLowerCase());
    for (let group of groups) {
        let count = 0
        for (let page of group.rows.sort(p => p.file.path, 'asc')) {
            count += 1;
        }

        if (count === 1 ) {
            continue;
        }

        for (let page of group.rows.sort(p => p.file.path, 'asc')) {
            dv.paragraph(page.file.link + ': ' + page.file.path);
        }
    }
}

listFileNameIssues(dv);
```

Pick random notes:

```javascript
const limit = 10;
const notes = dv.pages().sort(() => Math.random()).slice (0, limit).map(note => note.file.link);
dv.list(notes);
```

Count the number of notes:

```javascript
$=dv.pages().length
```

And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Check out the [official documentation of the dataview plugin](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) for more details about its possibilities.

## Templater
The templater plugin is a powerful templating engine for Obsidian. It provides many functions to help you create really cool templates.

Here's an example, again taken from the [Obsidian Starter Kit](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit) which uses the Templater plugin extensively:

```markdown
---
tags:
- weekly_notes
---

# <% tp.file.title %>
<< [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-[W]WW", "P-1W") %>]] | [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-[W]WW", "P+1W") %>]] >>
Current month: [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM") %>]] | Next month: [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM", "P+1M") %>]]
Year note: [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY") %>]]

## Goals
-

## Achievements
-

## Discoveries
### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD") %>]]
-

### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD", 1) %>]]
-

### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD", 2) %>]]
-

### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD", 3) %>]]
-

### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD", 4) %>]]
-

### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD", 5) %>]]
-

### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD", 6) %>]]
-

## Challenges
-

## Gratitude
-
```

Once you have created a template, you can easily add it to any note using the `ALT/Cmd + E` shortcut.

Take a look at the [Templater plugin reference documentation](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/) to learn more about its capabilities.

## Auto Note Mover
The Auto Note Mover is one of my favorite Obsidian plugin. It provides a way to automatically move notes around within your knowledge base. This is great as it removes the need to manually file notes.

## Homepage
The homepage plugin does exactly what it says: it lets you create a homepage for your knowledge base. I personally rely on this plugin to create my productivity dashboard. The homepage is just a note like any other, meaning that you can add whatever you want to it: text, titles, images, tasks, dataview queries, etc.

## Kanban
This plugin makes it possible to create [Kanban boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) in Obsidian. Thanks to this plugin, you could manage your entire todo list within Obsidian instead of using other tools such as Trello.

## Tasks

## Extract URL
This plugin makes it really easy to capture external content into Obsidian. It extracts Markdown compatible with Obsidian out of URLs. Thanks to this plugin, you can paste the URL of a Website in an Obsidian note, invoke a command and have the URL be replaced by the content converted into Markdown.

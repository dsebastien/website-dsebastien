I thought I could share my current Indie Hacking toolkit. Hopefully, you'll find something interesting here! A large portion of those tools can be used for free.

Note that only a tiny fraction of those tools are necessary, depending on the business you create/run. Keep in mind that a toolbox is just something that contains a set of tools that you _might_ need. You don't have to pick them all at once. They're in your toolbox, and you can pick them up when you need to use them. Moreover, you don't need to get all of those at once. You can get new tools when you actually need those ðŸ”§.

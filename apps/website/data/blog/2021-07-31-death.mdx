## A first encounter with death

The first time that I was confronted with death was when my grandfather died. I was still young, but I remember vividly how weird everything became for a few days. Smiles were nowhere to be seen, and silence was the new normal. Everything turned black around me. No other colors seemed to be allowed anymore, as if they were at fault for what just happened. I couldn't be myself. Being joyful, playing, running and yelling were not tolerated. None of what was happening made sense to me. I felt punished for no reason. I loved my grandpa, and wanted him back. But he was gone. He has just vanished.

A few days later, we went to the hospital to see "him". At first everyone told me that I couldn't get in. I had to stay in the hallway... and be quiet! It was so unfair! I was furious. Why wouldn't they let me in? I wanted to see him, tell him about how weird everything had become. Maybe he'd be able to talk some sense into everybody else. Finally, my mom came out, and asked me if I really wanted to get inside. She said that it might be scary for me, that he was not "beautiful to see" anymore. I was puzzled. Grandpa was never beautiful to see. His face was all wrinkled. It was funny to play with it, but it was not beautiful per se. I wasn't scared, I just wanted to see him, and ask why he left us for so long.

When I got into the room, everyone was gathered around him; whispering, crying and blowing their nose. As I approached the bed, I started crying too. I was scared. Grandpa was not smiling like he usually did. His eyes stayed closed, and he didn't move at all. He was paler than usual, and his hands were so cold. He didn't grab my hand like he used to.

Mom told me that he was "gone", that he had lived a long life and needed to get some rest. He had joined the rest of the family, up there, somewhere. At the time, death just didn't make any sense to me. I couldn't accept something that I did not understand.

## Life

After that traumatic episode, life went on, and colors quickly reappeared around me. For a while, I hoped that my grandfather would come back home; that he would be there one day when I went to visit my cousins. Each time I approached their house, I thought about him, and wondered... But of course he wasn't. I saw pictures of him, things that belonged to him, the chair where he spent his time. Souvenirs.

For the longest time, life and death remained concepts that I couldn't care less about. Time was much more present in my mind. Time to wake up, time to go to school, time to get back home, time to eat. Time time time. Time set the rhythm of my life. I wasn't concerned about when, how or why my life would end. Thirty-something years later, I still ain't worried. But time changes everything, starting with one's understanding about the world. The world with all its rules, its quirks, and its mysteries. Mysteries such as death.

Life is a truly unique gift that we have been lucky enough to be offered. That idea is widely accepted; life is wonderful. But death is just as
Even though most of us don't see things that way, I sincerely believe that death is an even greater gift, that most of us fail to appreciate



many of us don't realize that death is also a giftthat we often don't see as such.
Some of us often wonder why. Why are we here? Where are they gone? Why? The "why" really doesn't matter all that much.

But times changes us all. It changes our cells, our appearance, our environment, our ideas, our ideals, our beliefs. The whole world changes. All the time!

People die, of course, but so do other things.
Ideals.
Relationships.
Jobs.
Life phases.
Pieces of who we once were.
A death isn’t always inherently sad, either; sometimes, it’s a positive step, freeing us from what was weighing us down or allowing us to move forward.
Illusions can die.
Grudges.
Bad habits.

Tell us about a death you’ve experienced, for better or worse, and how you marked the loss — whether it was with mourning or celebration.

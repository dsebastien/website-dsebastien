Sometimes in life, we try too hard for too long.

_Update_: I’ve posted a follow up article, listing some steps that I’ve taken to improve the balance in my life: [https://medium.com/@dSebastien/steps-towards-a-better-work-life-equilibrium-5557af620e42](https://medium.com/@dSebastien/steps-towards-a-better-work-life-equilibrium-5557af620e42)

During the last few years, I’ve been working _too hard_. I’ve now grown (somehow) enough to admit it.

I pushed harder and harder to get above and beyond, however I could, literally for years. But working hard is never enough; there’s always one more thing to do, one more project to finish, one more idea to develop. It’s endless and there’s only so much one can do.

Working smart makes much more sense, but it’s not only that. It’s also a question of equilibrium. To make wise decisions and work at your best for long periods of time, there’s a balance to keep between work and private life. I did my best to keep that balance over the years, but simply neglected other important aspect of life, which are actually also part of the equilibrium formula: sleep, leisure, well-being and nutrition.

I was so focused on being more productive and to move my ideas & projects forward that I often skipped lunch, ate quickly, ignored my most basic needs, worked at night until 2–4AM instead of going to sleep and skipped exercise more often than not.

I reached a point where I just felt too overwhelmed, tired as hell and really had to stop and start thinking.

In the next post, I’ll explain the steps I’ve gradually taken to recharge my batteries and get ready for my next ten productive years! :)

In this article, I want to introduce the [Obsidian Starter Kit](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit). It's a solid starting point for anyone willing to take the stress-free path to organized note-making.

## Who is this for?
The Obsidian Starter Kit is for people who are just getting started with note-taking or just switched over to Obsidian. It's for people who want to take smart notes, learn better and retain more of what they read. It's for people who want to know how to properly organize their notes and avoid creating an overwhelming mess for themselves.

If you don't want to spend a ton of time researching and experimenting before you get productive, then use the Obsidian Starter Kit to skip to the fun part directly, using proven techniques like Zettelkasten, the PARA method, the Johnny decimal system, journaling and periodic reviews.

Getting started with Obsidian is not the hardest thing in the world, but it takes a lot of trial and error to figure out how to structure and organize your knowledge base. You have a busy life, and you don't want to spend weeks or even months figuring out the "right" approach.

## What is it?

I've been passionate about information, knowledge management, and PKM for [more than 20 years](https://pkmjournal.com/25-years-of-personal-knowledge-management-from-scattered-ideas-to-networked-thoughts-661e06855839). As a knowledge worker, author, blogger, and entrepreneur, I needed solutions to store and organize an enormous amount of information.

Over the years, I've explored, used, and advocated many tools but have been using Obsidian extensively since last year. With the Obsidian Starter Kit, I offer you the result of my own research and experimentation. It's like a cheat code to **jump straight to stress-free note-making**.

## What does it include?

If you buy access to the Obsidian Starter Kit, you'll get:

* The Obsidian vault
* The recommended structure
* The recommended plugins
* Examples: journaling, Zettelkasten, PARA, personal organization, resources, templates, Johnny decimal organization
* The user guide
* Lifetime access to the Personal Knowledge Management community for support and knowledge sharing

In addition, you'll also get free access to all future updates. In the coming months, I'll expand it step by step to include tutorials about the various aspects; from exploration/curation to summarization and reuse.

## Where can I get it?
[Obsidian Starter Kit](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit) is available on [Gumroad](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit).

That's it for today! âœ¨

In this article, I want to explain the differences I see between note-taking and note-making. One could consider I am splitting hairs, but I do believe that there's really an important distinction between both. Whether you agree or not, both are really [underrated](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2022-11-16-why-take-notes).

## What is note-taking
For me, note-taking is the act of capturing information and knowledge that comes from the outside world. That is, we take notes, either verbatim or using our own words in order to store what others have expressed.

Note-taking is an activity that we can perform anywhere, anytime. Whenever we read, see or hear something interesting, we can take notes about it. We can take notes during a course, during a meeting, while watching a presentation, while watching a YouTube video, while reading a [non-fiction book](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2022-02-08-why-you-should-take-notes-while-reading), etc. There are really countless cases where note-taking is useful, as I've argued in [my previous article](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2022-11-16-why-take-notes). The goal of those notes is usually to _help our future self_ find the information back at some point.

Generally speaking, notes are a condensed version of the information we've encountered. For instance a mind map or a set of bullet points that summarize an hour-long presentation. But it doesn't have to be the case.

We can also capture our own thoughts, remarks and opinions while taking notes. For instance, whenever I [take notes while reading non-fiction](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2022-02-17-how-to-capture-book-notes-and-create-smart-notes) , I complement those with my own thinking. This adds value to the captured information as it can then become a source of inspiration, a starting point for further research, etc.  As such, note-taking is also about capturing what information we encounter "triggers" within us.

## What is note-making
While note-taking is mostly focused on what comes from the outside, note-making is about expressing and capturing what comes from within. It's about expressing our own thoughts, ideas and opinions. It's about using our voice through writing. Note-making is also a powerful way to _think_. When we sit down to give form to our thoughts, we actually dig deeper within ourselves to find out what we really think and believe. We put words on emotions, on subtle ideas, impressions.

Note-making is thus a way to express ourselves. It's raw creativity, just like drawing, painting or taking photographs. Note-makers, writers and authors are one and the same. Some write to make a living. Some write because they want to grow, change the world, leave their mark, touch or influence people. Yet other ones just do it for fun. There are probably as many reasons to make notes as there are people alive. But all of those who do write have a strong need to express themselves.

Note-making is a wonderful creativity tool and a fantastic way to do some deep introspection.

## Note-taking and note-making are complementary
I've been arguing for quite a long time that note-taking is an essential skill for knowledge workers, students, and lifelong learners. I'm also convinced that note-making can make a huge difference in the lives of many people on earth.

The two are actually complementary and are two sides of the same coin. Note-taking allows capturing, ingesting, analyzing and understanding what we can from the world around us. Note-making allows us to express ourselves, learn more about ourselves, our feelings and emotions, as well as explore our own ideas.

By combining both note-taking and note-making, we can build upon everything we discover and learn from. We can go above and beyond, adding our own ideas on top of those that influence and help us grow. We can find our own voice, and let our creativity shine.

## Conclusion
In this article, I've shared my ideas about the difference between note-taking and note-making. I've argued that both are complementary and well worth exploring.

## What is the LIFT principle?
The LIFT principle was introduced by Google as part of the [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) and [Angular](https://angular.io/) style guides. It is a code organization best pratice for software developers. But in reality, this principle applies really well to [[Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)]] and [[Information Management (IM)]] in general.

LIFT is an acronym for:
- **L**ocate
- **I**dentify
- **F**lat structure as long as we can
- **T**ry to stay dry

This principle's goal is to ensure that we keep files and folder structures as flat as possible in order for us to be able to quickly locate and identify what we need. Also, it recommends applying the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle and thus avoiding duplicating information as much as possible.

Whenever you organize information, whether it is code, personal or work information, try to keep the LIFT principle in mind.

## Conclusion
In this article, I've introduced the LIFT principle, a recommendation to keep your organization systems as simple and as flat as possible in order to always be able to quickly locate and identify what you need.

That's it for today! âœ¨

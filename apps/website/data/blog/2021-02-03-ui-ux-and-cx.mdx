As some of you might know, I’m working on a series of books about [Software Development Concepts](https://gumroad.com/l/DevConcepts).

Among [many other things](https://www.dev-concepts.dev/table-of-contents), one of the books cover the basics of User Experience (UX), User Interface (UI), and Customer Experience (CX).

Tonight, I wanted to help my readers to visualize the difference between those. Here’s what I’ve come up with so far:

<BlogPostCenteredContent>
  <Image
    alt={`UI UX CX`}
    src={`/static/images/blog/2021/ui-ux-cx.png`}
    width={488}
    height={488}
    priority
  />
</BlogPostCenteredContent>

This diagram is directly inspired by [the one published here](https://www.booklets.io/b/cx-ux-ui-morejanda) by Michael Janda, extended with some ideas of mine.

Now that I have created the visualization, I can continue explaining those concepts… one by one ;-)

That's it for today! ✨

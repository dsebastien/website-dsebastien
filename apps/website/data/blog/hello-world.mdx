Hey there! Welcome to my new home on the Web ðŸŽ‰

I've finally decided to take a bit of time to create a new Website for my main domain. It was about time; I created [the previous version of my blog](https://github.com/dsebastien/midnightlight) back in 2011. I guess that one Website revamp per 10 year period should do it ;-)

The previous version was using Wordpress, and my own theme. It served its purpose, but it's clearly dated now. Moreover, Many posts were broken after the death of Google+ a long time ago, and editing articles was really a pain.

Since I don't have much time/energy to really have fun with the revamp, I've cloned a project I'm currently working on, and hacked away, taking a lot of inspiration from [Lee Robinson's wonderful website](https://leerob.io/). If you don't know Lee, then make sure to check out his top-notch content!

The sources of this site are [on Github](https://github.com/dsebastien/website-dsebastien). It's made with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (of course!), and a gazillion other things ^\_^.

In the coming days, I'll reimport my previous blog posts. Those will get new URLs, so I'm probably going to break the Web a little; sorry about that!

From now on, I plan on cross-posting my articles here, on [Medium](http://dsebastien.medium.com), [DEV.to](https://dev.to/dsebastien), and [Hashnode](https://dsebastien.hashnode.dev).

That's it for today! âœ¨
